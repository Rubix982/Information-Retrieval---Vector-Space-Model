amazon in a muslin dress upon it at the next a string of white swan would fli overhead shake with anger and cold and not know what to do yergunov fire hi revolv at the dog and did not hit one of them then he rush back to the hous when he went into the entri he distinctli heard someon scurri out of the room and bang the door it wa dark in the room yergunov push against the door it wa lock then light match after match he rush back into the entri from there into the kitchen and from the kitchen into a littl room where all the wall were hung with petticoat and dress where there wa a smell of cornflow and fennel and a bedstead with a perfect mountain of pillow stand in the corner by the stove thi must have been the old mother s room from there he pas into anoth littl room and here he saw lyubka she wa lie on a chest cover with a gay colour patchwork cotton quilt pretend to be asleep a littl ikon lamp wa burn in the corner abov the pillow where is my horse? yergunov ask lyubka did not stir where is my hors i am ask you? yergunov repeat still more sternli and he tore the quilt off her i am ask you she devil he shout she jump up on her knee and with one hand hold her shift and with

and with all hi might embrac the girl but hiss with furi she slip out of hi arm and free one hand—th other wa tangl in the torn shift—hit him a blow with her fist on the skull hi head wa dizzi with the pain there wa a ring and rattl in hi ear he stagger back and at that moment receiv anoth blow—thi time on the templ reel and clutch at the doorpost that he might not fall he made hi way to the room where hi thing were and lay down on the bench then after lie for a littl time took the matchbox out of hi pocket and began light match after match for no object: he lit it blew it out and threw it under the tabl and went on till all the match were gone meanwhil the air began to turn blue outsid the cock began to crow but hi head still ach and there wa an uproar in hi ear a though he were sit under a railway bridg and hear the train pas over hi head he got somehow into hi coat and cap the saddl and the bundl of hi purchas he could not find hi knapsack wa empty: it wa not for noth that someon had scurri out of the room when he came in from the yard he took a poker from the kitchen to keep off the dog and went out into the yard leav the door open the snow storm had subsid and it wa calm outsid when he went out at the gate the white plain look dead and there wa not a singl bird in the morn sky on both side of the road and in the distanc there were bluish patch of young cop yergunov began think how he would be greet at the hospit and what the doctor would say to him it wa absolut necessari to think of that and to prepar beforehand to answer question he would be ask but thi thought grew blur and slip away he walk along think of noth but lyubka of the peasant with whom he had pas the night he rememb how after lyubka struck him the second time she had bent down to the floor for the quilt and how her loo hair had fallen on the floor hi mind wa in a maze and he wonder whi there were in the world doctor hospit assist merchant clerk and peasant instead of simpl free men? there are to be sure free bird free beast a free merik and they are not afraid of anyon and don t need anyon and whose idea wa it who had decre that one must get up in the morn dine at midday go to bed in the even that a doctor take preced of a hospit assist that one must live in room and love onli one s wife? and whi not the contrary—din at night and sleep in the day? ah to jump on a hors without enquir whose it is to ride race with the wind like a devil over field and forest and ravin to make love to girl to mock at everyon yergunov thrust the poker into the snow press hi forehead to the cold white trunk of a birch tree and sank into thought and hi grey monoton life hi wage hi subordin posit the dispensari the everlast to do with the bottl and blister struck him a contempt sicken who say it s a sin to enjoy oneself? he ask himself with vexat those who say that have never live in freedom like merik and kalashnikov and have never love lyubka they have been beggar all their live have live without ani pleasur and have onli love their wive who are like frog and he thought about himself that he had not hitherto been a thief a swindler or even a brigand simpli becaus he could not or had not yet met with a suitabl opportun —— a year and a half pas in spring after easter yergunov who had long befor been dismiss from the hospit and wa hang about without a job came out of the tavern in ryepino and saunter aimlessli along the street he went out into the open countri here there wa the scent of spring and a warm caress wind wa blow the calm starri night look down from the sky on the earth my god how infinit the depth of the sky and with what fathomless immens it stretch over the world the world is creat well enough onli whi and with what right do peopl thought yergunov divid their fellow into the sober and the drunken the employ and the dismiss and so on whi do the sober and well fed sleep comfort in their home while the drunken and the hungri must wander about the countri without a refuge? whi wa it that if anyon had not a job and did not get a salari he had to go hungri without cloth and boots? whose idea wa it? whi wa it the bird and the wild beast in the wood did not have job and get salari but live a they pleased? far away in the sky a beauti crimson glow lay quiver stretch wide over the horizon yergunov stop and for a long time he gaze at it and kept wonder whi wa it that if he had carri off someon el s samovar the day befor and sold it for drink in the tavern it would be a sin? whi wa it? two cart drove by on the road in one of them there wa a woman asleep in the other sat an old man without a cap on grandfath where is that fire? ask yergunov andrey tchirikov s inn answer the old man and yergunov recal what had happen to him eighteen month befor in the winter in that veri inn and how merik had boast and he imagin the old woman and lyubka with their throat cut burn and he envi merik and when he walk back to the tavern look at the hous of the rich publican cattl dealer and blacksmith he reflect how nice it would be to steal by night into some rich man s hous
