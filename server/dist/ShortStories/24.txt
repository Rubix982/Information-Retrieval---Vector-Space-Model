she use to laugh at all that the doctor s chais stop by a well the examin magistr and the doctor drank some water stretch and wait for the coachman to finish water the hors well what did the ladi die of? ask the doctor when the chais wa roll along the road again she die in a strang way one fine day her husband went in to her and said that it wouldn t be amiss to sell their old coach befor the spring and to buy someth rather newer and lighter instead and that it might be a well to chang the left trace hors and to put bobtchinski (that wa the name of one of her husband s horses) in the shaft hi wife listen to him and said: ‘do a you think best but it make no differ to me now befor the summer i shall be in the cemeteri her husband of cours shrug hi shoulder and smile ‘i am not joke she said ‘i tell you in earnest that i shall soon be dead ‘what do you mean by soon? ‘directli after my confin i shall bear my child and die the husband attach no signific to these word he did not believ in presenti of ani sort and he knew that ladi in an interest condit are apt to be fanci and to give way to gloomi idea gener a day later hi wife spoke to him again of die immedi after her confin and then everi day she spoke of it and he laugh and call her a silli woman a fortun teller a crazi creatur her approach death becam an idã© fixã© with hi wife when her husband would not listen to her she would go into the kitchen and talk of her death to the nurs and the cook ‘i haven t long to live now nurs she would say ‘a soon a my confin is over i shall die i did not want to die so earli but it seem it s my fate the nurs and the cook were in tear of cours sometim the priest s wife or some ladi from a neighbour estat would come and see her and she would take them asid and open her soul to them alway harp on the same subject her approach death she spoke grave with an unpleas smile even with an angri face which would not allow ani contradict she had been smart and fashion in her dress but now in view of her approach death she becam slovenli she did not read she did not laugh she did not dream aloud what wa more she drove with her aunt to the cemeteri and select a spot for her tomb five day befor her confin she made her will and all thi bear in mind wa done in the best of health without the faintest hint of ill or danger a confin is a difficult affair and sometim fatal but in the case of which i am tell you everi indic wa favour and there wa absolut noth to be afraid of her husband wa sick of the whole busi at last he lost hi temper one day at dinner and ask her: ‘listen natasha when is there go to be an end of thi silliness? ‘it s not silli i am in earnest ‘nonsens i advis you to give over be silli that you may not feel asham of it afterward well the confin came the husband got the veri best midwif from the town it wa hi wife s first confin but it could not have gone better when it wa all over she ask to look at her babi she look at it and said: ‘well now i can die she said good bye shut her eye and half an hour later gave up her soul to god she wa fulli consciou up to the last moment anyway when they gave her milk instead of water she whisper softly: ‘whi are you give me milk instead of water? so that is what happen she die a she predict the examin magistr paus gave a sigh and said: come explain whi she die i assur you on my honour thi is not invent it s a fact the doctor look at the sky medit you ought to have had an inquest on her he said why? whi to find out the caus of her death she didn t die becaus she had predict it she poison herself most probabl the examin magistr turn quickli face the doctor and screw up hi eye asked: and from what do you conclud that she poison herself? i don t conclud it but i assum it wa she on good term with her husband? h m not altogeth there had been misunderstand soon after their marriag there were unfortun circumst she had found her husband on one occas with a ladi she soon forgav him howev and which came first her husband s infidel or her idea of dying? the examin magistr look attent at the doctor a though he were tri to imagin whi he put that question excus me he said not quit immedi let me tri and rememb the examin magistr took off hi hat and rub hi forehead ye ye it wa veri shortli after that incid that she began talk of death ye ye well there do you see? in all probabl it wa at that time that she made up her mind to poison herself but a most like she did not want to kill her child also she put it off till after her confin not like not like it s imposs she forgav him at the time that she forgav it quickli mean that she had someth bad in her mind young wive do not forgiv quickli the examin magistr gave a forc smile and to conceal hi too notic agit began light a cigarett not like not like he went on no notion of anyth of the sort be possibl ever enter into my head and besid he wa not so much to blame a it seem he wa unfaith to her in rather a queer way with no desir to be he came home at night somewhat elev want to make love to somebodi hi wife wa in an interest condit then he came across a ladi who had come to stay for three days—damn take her— an empti head creatur silli and not good look it couldn t be reckon a an infidel hi wife look at it in that way herself and soon forgav it noth more wa said about it peopl don t die without a reason said the doctor that is so of cours but all the same i cannot admit that she poison herself but it is strang that the idea ha never struck me befor and no one thought of it everyon wa astonish that her predict had come to pas and the idea of such a death wa far from their mind and inde it cannot be that she poison herself no the examin magistr ponder the thought of the woman who had die so strang haunt him all through the inquest a he note down what the doctor dictat to him he move hi eyebrow gloomili and rub hi forehead and are there realli poison that kill one in a quarter of an hour gradual without ani pain? he ask the doctor while the latter wa open the skull ye there are morphia for instanc h m strang i rememb she use to keep someth of the sort but it could hardli be on the way back the examin magistr look exhaust he kept nervous bite hi moustach and wa unwil to talk let u go a littl way on foot he said to the doctor i am tire of sit after walk about a hundr pace the examin magistr seem to the doctor to be overcom with fatigu a though he had been climb up a high mountain he stop and look at the doctor with a strang look in hi eye a though he were drunk said: my god if your theori is correct whi it s it wa cruel inhuman she poison herself to punish some one el whi wa the sin so great? oh my god and whi did you make me a present of thi damnabl idea doctor the examin magistr clutch at hi head in despair and went on: what i have told you wa about my own wife about myself oh my god i wa to blame i wound her but can it have been easier to die than to forgive? that s typic feminin logic—cruel merciless logic oh even then when she wa live she wa cruel i recal it all now it s all clear to me now a the examin magistr talk he shrug hi shoulder then clutch at hi head he got back into the carriag then walk again the new idea the doctor had impart to him seem to have overwhelm him to have poison him he wa distract shatter in bodi and soul and when he got back to the town he said good bye to the doctor declin to stay to dinner though he had promis the doctor the even befor to dine with him
