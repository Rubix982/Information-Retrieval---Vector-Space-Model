for him they light the lamp befor the ikon zhmuhin went to bed in hi own room and a he lay there he thought of hi soul of hi age of hi recent stroke which had so frighten him and made him think of death he wa fond of philosoph when he wa in quiet by himself and then he fanci that he wa a veri earnest deep thinker and that noth in thi world interest him but seriou question and now he kept think and he long to pitch upon some one signific thought unlik other which would be a guid to him in life and he want to think out principl of some sort for himself so a to make hi life a deep and earnest a he imagin that he felt himself to be it would be a good thing for an old man like him to abstain altogeth from meat from superflu of all sort the time when men give up kill each other and anim would come sooner or later it could not but be so and he imagin that time to himself and clearli pictur himself live in peac with all the anim and suddenli he thought again of the pig and everyth wa in a tangl in hi brain it s a queer busi lord have merci upon u he mutter sigh heavili are you asleep? he ask no zhmuhin got out of bed and stop in the doorway with noth but hi shirt on display to hi guest hi sinewi leg that look a dri a stick nowaday you know he began all sort of telegraph telephon and marvel of all kind in fact have come in but peopl are no better than they were they say that in our

expression) we took that princess and gave her a good thrash and she gave up come there s an instanc for you nowaday of cours there is not the same class of peopl and they are not given to thrash and they live in cleaner style and there is more learn but you know the soul is just the same: there is no chang now look here there s a landown live here among u he ha mine you know all sort of tramp without passport who don t know where to go work for him on saturday he ha to settl up with the workman but he doesn t care to pay them you know he grudg the money so he s got hold of a foreman who is

you asleep? no answer the visitor zhmuhin got up and thud with hi heel walk through the parlour and the entri to the kitchen to get a drink of water the worst thing in the world you know is stupid he said a littl later come back with a dipper my lyubov osipovna is on her knee say her prayer she pray everi night you know and bow down to the ground first that her child may be sent to school she is afraid her boy will go into the armi a simpl cossack and that they will be whack across their back with sabr but for teach one must have money and where is one to get it? you may break the floor beat

a full moon wa float in the sky just over the yard and in the moonlight the hous and barn look whiter than by day and on the grass brilliant streak of moonlight white too stretch between the black shadow far away on the right could be seen the stepp abov it the star were softli glowing—and it wa all mysteri infinit far away a though one were gaze into a deep abyss while on the left heavi storm cloud black a soot were pile up one upon anoth abov the stepp their edg were light up by the moon and it look a though there were mountain there with white snow on their peak dark forest the sea there wa a flash of lightn a faint rumbl of thunder and it seem a though a battl were be fought in the mountain quit close to the hous a littl night owl screech monotonously: asleep asleep what time is it now? ask the visitor just after one how long it is still to dawn they went back to the hous and lay down again it wa time to sleep and one can usual sleep so splendidli befor rain but the old man had a hanker after seriou weighti thought he want not simpli to think but to medit and he medit how good it would be a death wa near at hand for the sake of hi soul to give up the idl which so impercept swallow up day after day year after year leav no trace to think out for himself some great exploit—for instanc to walk on foot far far away or to give up meat like thi young man and again he pictur to himself the time when anim would not be kill pictur it clearli and distinctli a though he were live through that time himself but suddenli it wa all in a tangl again in hi head and all wa muddl the thunderstorm had pas over but from the edg of the storm cloud came rain softli patter on the roof zhmuhin got up stretch and groan with old age and look into the parlour notic that hi visitor wa not

round for me whi so? wait a littl and the rain will be over no i entreat you said the visitor in horror with a supplic voic it is essenti for me to go at onc and he began hurriedli dress by the time the hors wa har the sun wa rise it had just left off rain the cloud were race swiftli by and the patch of blue were grow bigger and bigger in the sky the first ray of the sun were timidli reflect below in the big puddl the visitor walk through the entri with hi portfolio to get into the trap and at that moment zhmuhin s wife pale and it seem paler than the day befor with tear stain eye look at him intent without balink with the naã¯v express of a littl girl and it wa evid from her deject face that she wa envi him hi freedom—oh with what joy she would have gone away from there —and she want to say someth to him most like to ask advic about her child and what a pitiabl figur she wa thi wa not a wife not the head of a hous not even a servant but more like a depend a poor relat not want by anyon a nonent her husband fuss about talk unceasingli wa see hi visitor off continu run in front of him while she huddl up to the wall with a timid guilti air wait for a conveni minut to speak plea
