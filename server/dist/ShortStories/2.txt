afterward the hous with all their belong wa sold by auction and ivan dmitritch and hi mother were left entir without mean hitherto in hi father s lifetim ivan dmitritch who wa studi in the univers of petersburg had receiv an allow of sixti or seventi roubl a month and had had no concept of poverti now he had to make an abrupt chang in hi life he had to spend hi time from morn to night give lesson for next to noth to work at copi and with all that to go hungri a all hi earn were sent to keep hi mother ivan dmitritch could not stand such a life he lost heart and strength and give up the univers went home here through interest he obtain the post of teacher in the district school but could not get on with hi colleagu wa not like by the boy and soon gave up the post hi mother die he wa for six month without work live on noth but bread and water then he becam a court usher he kept thi post until he wa dismiss owe to hi ill he had never even in hi young student day given the impress of be perfectli healthi he had alway been pale thin and given to catch cold he ate littl and slept badli a singl glass of wine went to hi head and made him hyster he alway had a crave for societi but owe to hi irrit tempera and suspici he never becam veri intim with anyon and had no friend he alway spoke with contempt of hi fellow townsman say that their coars ignor and sleepi anim exist seem to him loathsom and horribl he spoke in a loud tenor with heat and invari either with scorn and indign or with wonder and enthusiasm and alway with perfect sincer whatev one talk to him about he alway brought it round to the same subject: that life wa dull and stifl in the town that the townspeopl had no lofti interest but live a dingi meaningless life diversifi by violenc coars profligaci and hypocrisi that scoundrel were well fed and cloth while honest men live from hand to mouth that they need school a progress local paper a theatr public lectur the co ordin of the intellectu element that societi must see it fail and be horrifi in hi critic of peopl he laid on the colour thick use onli black and white and no fine shade mankind wa divid for him into honest men and scoundrels: there wa noth in between he alway spoke with passion and enthusiasm of woman and of love but he had never been in love in spite of the sever of hi judgment and hi nervous he wa like and behind hi back wa spoken of affection a vanya hi innat refin and readi to be of servic hi good breed hi moral puriti and hi shabbi coat hi frail appear and famili misfortun arous a kind warm sorrow feel moreov he wa well educ and well read accord to the townspeopl s notion he knew everyth and wa in their eye someth like a walk encyclopedia he had read a great deal he would sit at the club nervous pull at hi beard and look through the magazin and book and from hi face one could see that he wa not read but devour the page without give himself time to digest what he read it must be suppos that read wa one of hi morbid habit a he fell upon anyth that came into hi hand with equal avid even last year s newspap and calendar at home he alway read lie down iii one autumn morn ivan dmitritch turn up the collar of hi greatcoat and splash through the mud made hi way by side street and back lane to see some artisan and to collect some payment that wa owe he wa in a gloomi mood a he alway wa in the morn in one of the side street he wa met by two convict in fetter and four soldier with rifl in charg of them ivan dmitritch had veri often met convict befor and they had alway excit feel of compass and discomfort in him but now thi meet made a peculiar strang impress on him it suddenli seem to him for some reason that he too might be put into fetter and led through the mud to prison like that after visit the artisan on the way home he met near the post offic a polic superintend of hi acquaint who greet him and walk a few pace along the street with him and for some reason thi seem to him suspici at home he could not get the convict or the soldier with their rifl out of hi head all day and an unaccount inward agit prevent him from read or concentr hi mind in the even he did not light hi lamp and at night he could not sleep but kept think that he might be arrest put into fetter and thrown into prison he did not know of ani harm he had done and could be certain that he would never be guilti of murder arson or theft in the futur either but wa it not easi to commit a crime by accid unconsci and wa not fals wit alway possibl and inde miscarriag of justice? it wa not without good reason that the agelong experi of the simpl peopl teach that beggari and prison are ill none can be safe from a judici mistak is veri possibl a legal proceed are conduct nowaday and there is noth to be wonder at in it peopl who have an offici profession relat to other men s sufferings—for instanc judg polic offic doctors—in cours of time through habit grow so callou that they cannot even if they wish it take ani but a formal attitud to their client in thi respect they are not differ from the peasant who slaughter sheep and calv in the back yard and doe not notic the blood with thi formal soulless attitud to human person the judg need but one thing—time—in order to depriv an innoc man of all right of properti and to condemn him to penal servitud onli the time spent on perform certain formal for which the judg is paid hi salari and then—it is all over then you may look in vain for justic and protect in thi dirti wretch littl town a hundr and fifti mile from a railway station and inde is it not absurd even to think of justic when everi kind of violenc is accept by societi a a ration and consist necess and everi act of mercy—for instanc a verdict of acquittal—cal forth a perfect outburst of dissatisfi and reveng feeling? in the morn ivan dmitritch got up from hi bed in a state of horror with cold perspir on hi forehead complet convinc that he might be arrest ani minut sinc hi gloomi thought of yesterday had haunt him so long he thought it must be that there wa some truth in them they could not inde have come into hi mind without ani ground whatev a policeman walk slowli pas by the windows: that wa not for noth here were two men stand still and silent near the hous whi were they silent? and agon day and night follow for ivan dmitritch everyon who pas by the window or came into the yard seem to him a spi or a detect at midday the chief of the polic usual drove down the street with a pair of hors he wa go from hi estat near the town to the polic depart but ivan dmitritch fanci everi time that he wa drive especi quickli and that he had a peculiar expression: it wa evid that he wa in hast to announc that there wa a veri import crimin in the town ivan dmitritch start at everi ring at the bell and knock at the gate and wa agit whenev he came upon anyon new at hi landladi s when he met polic offic and gendarm he smile and began whistl so a to seem unconcern he could not sleep for whole night in success expect to be arrest but he snore loudli and sigh a though in deep sleep that hi landladi might think he wa asleep for if he could not sleep it meant that he wa torment by the sting of conscience—what a piec of evid fact and common sen persuad him that all these terror were nonsens and morbid that if one look at the matter more broadli there wa noth realli terribl in arrest and imprisonment—so long a the conscienc is at ea but the more sensibl and logic he reason the more acut and agon hi mental distress becam it might be compar with the stori of a hermit who tri to cut a dwell place for himself in a virgin forest the more zealous he work with hi axe the thicker the forest grew in the end ivan dmitritch see it wa useless gave up reason altogeth and abandon himself entir to despair and terror he began to avoid peopl and to seek solitud hi offici work had been distast to him before: now it becam unbear to him he wa afraid they would somehow get him into troubl would put a bribe in hi pocket unnot and then denounc him or that he would accident make a mistak in offici paper that would appear to be fraudul or would lose other peopl s money it is strang that hi imagin had never at other time been so agil and invent a now when everi day he thought of thousand of differ reason for be serious anxiou over hi freedom and honour but on the other hand hi interest in the outer world in book in particular grew sensibl fainter and hi memori began to fail him in the spring when the snow melt there were found in the ravin near the cemeteri two half decompos corpses—th bodi of an old woman and a boy bear the trace of death by violenc noth wa talk of but these bodi and their unknown murder that peopl might not think he had been guilti of the crime ivan dmitritch walk about the street smile and when he met acquaint he turn pale flush and began declar that there wa no greater crime than the murder of the weak and defenceless but thi duplic soon exhaust him and after some reflect he decid that in hi posit the best thing to do wa to hide in hi landladi s cellar he sat in the cellar all day and then all night then anoth day wa fear cold and wait till dusk stole secretli like a thief back to hi room he stood in the middl of the room till daybreak listen without stir veri earli in the morn befor sunris some workman came into the hous ivan dmitritch knew perfectli well that they had come to mend the stove in the kitchen but terror told him that they were polic offic disguis a workman he slip stealthili out of the flat and overcom by terror ran along the street without hi cap and coat dog race after him bark a peasant shout somewher behind him the wind whistl in hi ear and it seem to ivan dmitritch that the forc and violenc of the whole world wa mass togeth behind hi back and wa chase after him he wa stop and brought home and hi landladi sent for a doctor doctor andrey yefimitch of whom we shall have more to say hereaft prescrib cold compress on hi head and laurel drop shook hi head and went away tell the landladi he should not come again a one should not interfer with peopl who are go out of their mind a he had not the mean to live at home and be nurs ivan dmitritch wa soon sent to the hospit and wa there put into the ward for vener patient he could not sleep at night wa full of whim and fanci and disturb the patient and wa soon afterward by andrey yefimitch s order transfer to ward no 6 within a year ivan dmitritch wa complet forgotten in the town and hi book heap up by hi landladi in a sledg in the shed were pull to piec by boy iv ivan dmitritch s neighbour on the left hand is a i have said alreadi the jew moiseika hi neighbour on the right hand is a peasant so roll in fat that he is almost spheric with a blankli stupid face utterli devoid of thought thi is a motionless glutton unclean anim who ha long ago lost all power of thought or feel an acrid stifl stench alway come from him nikita who ha to clean up after him beat him terribl with all hi might not spare hi fist and what is dread is not hi be beaten—that one can get use to—but the fact that thi stupefi creatur doe not respond to the blow with a sound or a movement nor by a look in the eye but onli sway a littl like a heavi barrel the fifth and last inhabit of ward no 6 is a man of the artisan class who had onc been a sorter in the post offic a thinnish fair littl man with a good natur but rather sli face to judg from the clear cheer look in hi calm and intellig eye he ha some pleasant idea in hi mind and ha some veri import and agreeabl secret he ha under hi pillow and under hi mattress someth that he never show anyon not from fear of it be taken from him and stolen but from modesti sometim he goe to the window and turn hi back to hi companion put someth on hi breast and bend hi head look at it if you go up to him at such a moment he is overcom with confus and snatch someth off hi breast but it is not difficult to guess hi secret congratul me he often say to ivan dmitritch i have been present with the stanislav order of the second degre with the star the second degre with the star is onli given to foreign but for some reason they want to make an except for me he say with a smile shrug hi shoulder in perplex that i must confess i did not expect i don t understand anyth about that ivan dmitritch repli moro but do you know what i shall attain to sooner or later? the former sorter persist screw up hi eye slyli i shall certainli get the swedish ‘polar star that s an order it is worth work for a white cross with a black ribbon it s veri beauti probabl in no other place is life so monoton a in thi ward in the morn the patient except the paralyt and the fat peasant wash in the entri at a big tab and wipe themselv with the skirt of their dress gown after that they drink tea out of tin mug which nikita bring them out of the main build everyon is allow one mug at midday they have soup made out of sour cabbag and boil grain in the even their supper consist of grain left from dinner in the interv they lie down sleep look out of window and walk from one corner to the other and so everi day even the former sorter alway talk of the same order fresh face are rare seen in ward no 6 the doctor ha not taken in ani new mental case for a long time and the peopl who are fond of visit lunat asylum are few in thi world onc everi two month semyon lazaritch the barber appear in the ward how he cut the patient hair and how nikita help him to do it and what a trepid the lunat are alway thrown into by the arriv of the drunken smile barber we will not describ no one even look into the ward except the barber the patient are condemn to see day after day no one but nikita a rather strang rumour ha howev been circul in the hospit of late it is rumour that the doctor ha begun to visit ward no 6 v a strang rumour dr andrey yefimitch ragin is a strang man in hi way they say that when he wa young he wa veri religi and prepar himself for a cleric career and that when he had finish hi studi at the high school in 1863 he intend to enter a theolog academi but that hi father a surgeon and doctor of medicin jeer at him and declar point blank that he would disown him if he becam a priest how far thi is true i don t know but andrey yefimitch himself ha more than onc confess that he ha never had a natur bent for medicin or scienc in gener howev that may have been when he finish hi studi in the medic faculti he did not enter the priesthood he show no special devout and wa no more like a priest at the begin of hi medic career than he is now hi exterior is heavy—coars like a peasant s hi face hi beard hi flat hair and hi coars clumsi figur suggest an overf intemper and harsh innkeep on the highroad hi face is surli look and cover with blue vein hi eye are littl and hi nose is red with hi height and broad shoulder he ha huge hand and foot one would think that a blow from hi fist would knock the life out of anyon but hi step is soft and hi walk is cautiou and insinu when he meet anyon in a narrow passag he is alway the first to stop and make way and to say not in a bass a one would expect but in a high soft tenor: i beg your pardon he ha a littl swell on hi neck which prevent him from wear stiff starch collar and so he alway goe about in soft linen or cotton shirt altogeth he doe not dress like a doctor he wear the same suit for ten year and the new cloth which he usual buy at a jewish shop look a shabbi and crumpl on him a hi old one he see patient and dine and pay visit all in the same coat but thi is not due to niggardli but to complet careless about hi appear when andrey yefimitch came to the town to take up hi duti the institut found to the glori of god wa in a terribl condit one could hardli breath for the stench in the ward in the passag and in the courtyard of the hospit the hospit servant the nurs and their child slept in the ward togeth with the patient they complain that there wa no live for beetl bug and mouse the surgic ward were never free from erysipela there were onli two scalpel and not one thermomet in the whole hospit potato were kept in the bath the superintend the housekeep and the medic assist rob the patient and of the old doctor andrey yefimitch s predecessor peopl declar that he secretli sold the hospit alcohol and that he kept a regular harem consist of nurs and femal patient these disorderli proceed were perfectli well known in the town and were even exagger but peopl took them calmli some justifi them on the ground that there were onli peasant and work men in the hospit who could not be dissatisfi sinc they were much wors off at home than in the hospital—they couldn t be fed on woodcock other said in excus that the town alon without help from the zemstvo wa not equal to maintain a good hospit thank god for have one at all even a poor one and the newli form zemstvo did not open infirmari either in the town or the neighbourhood reli on the fact that the town alreadi had it hospit after look over the hospit andrey yefimitch came to the conclus that it wa an immor institut and extrem prejudici to the health of the townspeopl in hi opinion the most sensibl thing that could be done wa to let out the patient and close the hospit but he reflect that hi will alon wa not enough to do thi and that it would be useless if physic and moral impur were driven out of one place they would onli move to anoth one must wait for it to wither away of itself besid if peopl open a hospit and put up with have it it must be becaus they need it superstit and all the nasti and abomin of daili life were necessari sinc in process of time they work out to someth sensibl just a manur turn into black earth there wa noth on earth so good that it had not someth nasti about it first origin when andrey yefimitch undertook hi duti he wa appar not greatli concern about the irregular at the hospit he onli ask the attend and nurs not to sleep in the ward and had two cupboard of instrument put up the superintend the housekeep the medic assist and the erysipela remain unchang andrey yefimitch love intellig and honesti intens but he had no strength of will nor belief in hi right to organ an intellig and honest life about him he wa absolut unabl to give order to forbid thing and to insist it seem a though he had taken a vow never to rais hi voic and never to make use of the imper it wa difficult for him to say fetch or bring when he want hi meal he would cough hesitatingli and say to the cook how about tea? or how about dinner? to dismiss the superintend or to tell him to leav off steal or to abolish the unnecessari parasit post altogeth wa absolut beyond hi power when andrey yefimitch wa deceiv or flatter or account he knew to be cook were brought him to sign he would turn a red a a crab and feel guilti but yet he would sign the account when the patient complain to him of be hungri or of the rough of the nurs he would be confus and mutter guiltily: veri well veri well i will go into it later most like there is some misunderstand at first andrey yefimitch work veri zealous he saw patient everi day from morn till dinner time perform oper and even attend confin the ladi said of him that he wa attent and clever at diagnos diseas especi those of woman and child but in process of time the work unmistak weari him by it monotoni and obviou useless to day one see thirti patient and to morrow they have increas to thirti five the next day forti and so on from day to day from year to year while the mortal in the town did not decreas and the patient did not leav off come to be ani real help to forti patient between morn and dinner wa not physic possibl so it could but lead to decept if twelv thousand patient were seen in a year it meant if one look at it simpli that twelv thousand men were deceiv to put those who were serious ill into ward and to treat them accord to the principl of scienc wa imposs too becaus though there were principl there wa no scienc if he were to put asid philosophi and pedant follow the rule a other doctor did the thing abov all necessari were cleanli and ventil instead of dirt wholesom nourish instead of broth made of stink sour cabbag and good assist instead of thiev and inde whi hinder peopl die if death is the normal and legitim end of everyone? what is gain if some shop keeper or clerk live an extra five or ten years? if the aim of medicin is by drug to allevi suffer the question forc itself on one: whi allevi it? in the first place they say that suffer lead man to perfect and in the second if mankind realli learn to allevi it suffer with pill and drop it will complet abandon religion and philosophi in which it ha hitherto found not mere protect from all sort of troubl but even happi pushkin suffer terribl agoni befor hi death poor hein lay paralyz for sever year whi then should not some andrey yefimitch or matryona savishna be ill sinc their live had noth of import in them and would have been entir empti and like the life of an amoeba except for suffering? oppress by such reflect andrey yefimitch relax hi effort and gave up visit the hospit everi day vi hi life wa pas like thi a a rule he got up at eight o clock in the morn dress and drank hi tea then he sat down in hi studi to read or went to the hospit at the hospit the out patient were sit in the dark narrow littl corridor wait to be seen by the doctor the nurs and the attend tramp with their boot over the brick floor ran by them gaunt look patient in dress gown pas dead bodi and vessel full of filth were carri by the child were cri and there wa a cold draught andrey yefimitch knew that such surround were tortur to feverish consumpt and impression patient but what could be done? in the consult room he wa met by hi assist sergey sergeyitch—a fat littl man with a plump well wash shaven face with soft smooth manner wear a new loo cut suit and look more like a senat than a medic assist he had an immens practic in the town wore a white tie and consid himself more profici than the doctor who had no practic in the corner of the consult room there stood a larg ikon in a shrine with a heavi lamp in front of it and near it a candl stand with a white cover on it on the wall hung portrait of bishop a view of the svyatogorski monasteri and wreath of dri cornflow sergey sergeyitch wa religi and like solemn and decorum the ikon had been put up at hi expens at hi instruct some one of the patient read the hymn of prais in the consult room on sunday and after the read sergey sergeyitch himself went through the ward with a censer and burn incens there were a great mani patient but the time wa short and so the work wa confin to the ask of a few brief question and the administr of some drug such a castor oil or volatil ointment andrey yefimitch would sit with hi cheek rest in hi hand lost in thought and ask question mechan sergey sergeyitch sat down too rub hi hand and from time to time put in hi word we suffer pain and poverti he would say becaus we do not pray to the merci god a we should ye andrey yefimitch never perform ani oper when he wa see patient he had long ago given up do so and the sight of blood upset him when he had to open a child s mouth in order to look at it throat and the child cri and tri to defend itself with it littl hand the nois in hi ear made hi head go round and brought tear to hi eye he would make hast to prescrib a drug and motion to the woman to take the child away he wa soon weari by the timid of the patient and their incoher by the proxim of the piou sergey sergeyitch by the portrait on the wall and by hi own question which he had ask over and over again for twenti year and he would go away after see five or six patient the rest would be seen by hi assist in hi absenc with the agreeabl thought that thank god he had no privat practic now and that no one would interrupt him andrey yefimitch sat down to the tabl immedi on reach home and took up a book he read a great deal and alway with enjoy half hi salari went on buy book and of the six room that made up hi abod three were heap up with book and old magazin he like best of all work on histori and philosophi the onli medic public to which he subscrib wa the doctor of which he alway read the last page first he would alway go on read for sever hour without a break and without be weari he did not read a rapidli and impuls a ivan dmitritch had done in the past but slowli and with concentr often paus over a passag which he like or did not find intellig near the book there alway stood a decant of vodka and a salt cucumb or a pickl appl lay besid it not on a plate but on the baiz tabl cloth everi half hour he would pour himself out a glass of vodka and drink it without take hi eye off the book then without look at it he would feel for the cucumb and bite off a bit at three o clock he would go cautious to the kitchen door cough and say daryushka what about dinner? after hi dinner—a rather poor and untidili serv one—andrey yefimitch would walk up and down hi room with hi arm fold think the clock would strike four then five and still he would be walk up and down think occasion the kitchen door would creak and the red and sleepi face of daryushka would appear andrey yefimitch isn t it time for you to have your beer? she would ask anxious no it s not time yet he would answer i ll wait a littl i ll wait a littl toward the even the postmast mihail averyanitch the onli man in town whose societi did not bore andrey yefimitch would come in mihail averyanitch had onc been a veri rich landown and had serv in the calvari but had come to ruin and wa forc by poverti to take a job in the post offic late in life he had a hale and hearti appear luxuri grey whisker the manner of a well bred man and a loud pleasant voic he wa good natur and emot but hot temper when anyon in the post offic made a protest express disagr or even began to argu mihail averyanitch would turn crimson shake all over and shout in a voic of thunder hold your tongu so that the post offic had long enjoy the reput of an institut which it wa terribl to visit mihail averyanitch like and respect andrey yefimitch for hi cultur and the lofti of hi soul he treat the other inhabit of the town supercili a though they were hi subordin here i am he would say go in to andrey yefimitch good even my dear fellow i ll be bound you are get sick of me aren t you? on the contrari i am delight said the doctor i am alway glad to see you the friend would sit on the sofa in the studi and for some time would smoke in silenc daryushka what about the beer? andrey yefimitch would say they would drink their first bottl still in silenc the doctor brood and mihail averyanitch with a gay and anim face like a man who ha someth veri interest to tell the doctor wa alway the one to begin the convers what a piti he would say quietli and slowli not look hi friend in the face (he never look anyon in the face)— what a great piti it is that there are no peopl in our town who are capabl of carri on intellig and interest convers or care to do so it is an immens privat for u even the educ class do not rise abov vulgar the level of their develop i assur you is not a bit higher than that of the lower order perfectli true i agre you know of cours the doctor went on quietli and deliber that everyth in thi world is insignific and uninterest except the higher spiritu manifest of the human mind intellect draw a sharp line between the anim and man suggest the divin of the latter and to some extent even take the place of the immort which doe not exist consequ the intellect is the onli possibl sourc of enjoy we see and hear of no trace of intellect about u so we are depriv of enjoy we have book it is true but that is not at all the same a live talk and convers if you will allow me to make a not quit apt comparison: book are the print score while talk is the sing perfectli true a silenc would follow daryushka would come out of the kitchen and with an express of blank deject would stand in the doorway to listen with her face prop on her fist eh mihail averyanitch would sigh to expect intellig of thi gener and he would describ how wholesom entertain and interest life had been in the past how intellig the educ class in russia use to be and what lofti idea it had of honour and friendship how they use to lend money without an iou and it wa thought a disgrac not to give a help hand to a comrad in need and what campaign what adventur what skirmish what comrad what woman and the caucasu what a marvel countri the wife of a battalion command a queer woman use to put on an offic s uniform and drive off into the mountain in the even alon without a

yefimitch would listen without hear he wa muse a he sip hi beer i often dream of intellectu peopl and convers with them he said suddenli interrupt mihail averyanitch my father gave me an excel educ but under the influenc of the idea of the sixti made me becom a doctor i believ if i had not obey him then by now i should have been in the veri centr of the intellectu movement most like i should have becom a member of some univers of cours intellect too is transient and not etern but you know whi i cherish a partial for it life is a vexati trap when a think man reach matur and attain to full conscious he cannot help feel that he is in a trap from which there is no escap inde he is summon without hi choic by fortuit circumst from non exist into life what for? he tri to find out the mean and object of hi exist he is told noth or he is told absurd he knock and it is not open to him death come to him—also without hi choic and so just a in prison men held togeth by common misfortun feel more at ea when they are togeth so one doe not notic the trap in life when peopl with a bent for analysi and gener meet togeth and pas their time in the interchang of proud and free idea in that sen the intellect is the sourc of an enjoy noth can replac perfectli true not look hi friend in the face andrey yefimitch would go on quietli and with paus talk about intellectu peopl and convers with them and mihail averyanitch would listen attent and agree: perfectli true and you do not believ in the immort of the soul? he would ask suddenli no honour mihail averyanitch i do not believ it and have no ground for believ it i must own i doubt it too and yet i have a feel a though i should never die oh i think to myself: ‘old fogey it is time you were dead but there is a littl voic in my soul says: ‘don t believ it you won t die soon after nine o clock mihail averyanitch would go away a he put on hi fur coat in the entri he would say with a sigh: what a wilder fate ha carri u to though realli what s most vexati of all is to have to die here ech vii after see hi friend out andrey yefimitch would sit down at the tabl and begin read again the still of the even and afterward of the night wa not broken by a singl sound and it seem a though time were stand still and brood with the doctor over the book and a though there were noth in exist but the book and the lamp with the green shade the doctor s coars peasant like face wa gradual light up by a smile of delight and enthusiasm over the progress of the human intellect oh whi is not man immortal? he thought what is the good of the brain centr and convolut what is the good of sight speech self conscious geniu if it is all destin to depart into the soil and in the end to grow cold togeth with the earth s crust and then for million of year to fli with the earth round the sun with no mean and no object? to do that there wa no need at all to draw man with hi lofti almost godlik intellect out of non exist and then a though in mockeri to turn him into clay the transmut of substanc but what cowardic to comfort oneself with that cheap substitut for immort the unconsci process that take place in natur are lower even than the stupid of man sinc in stupid there is anyway conscious and will while in those process there is absolut noth onli the coward who ha more fear of death than digniti can comfort himself with the fact that hi bodi will in time live again in the grass in the stone in the toad to find one s immort in the transmut of substanc is a strang a to prophesi a brilliant futur for the case after a preciou violin ha been broken and becom useless when the clock struck andrey yefimitch would sink back into hi chair and close hi eye to think a littl and under the influenc of the fine idea of which he had been read he would unawar recal hi past and hi present the past wa hateful—bett not to think of it and it wa the same in the present a in the past he knew that at the veri time when hi thought were float togeth with the cool earth round the sun in the main build besid hi abod peopl were suffer in sick and physic impurity: someon perhap could not sleep and wa make war upon the insect someon wa be infect by erysipela or moan over too tight a bandag perhap the patient were play card with the nurs and drink vodka accord to the yearli return twelv thousand peopl had been deceiv the whole hospit rest a it had done twenti year ago on thiev filth scandal gossip on gross quackeri and a befor it wa an immor institut extrem injuri to the health of the inhabit he knew that nikita knock the patient about behind the bar window of ward no 6 and that moiseika went about the town everi day beg alm on the other hand he knew veri well that a magic chang had taken place in medicin dure the last twenti five year when he wa studi at the univers he had fanci that medicin would soon be overtaken by the fate of alchemi and metaphys but now when he wa read at night the scienc of medicin touch him and excit hi wonder and even enthusiasm what unexpect brillianc what a revolut thank to the antisept system oper were perform such a the great pirogov had consid imposs even in spe ordinari zemstvo doctor were ventur to perform the resect of the kneecap of abdomin oper onli one per cent wa fatal while stone wa consid such a trifl that they did not even write about it a radic cure for syphili had been discov and the theori of hered hypnot the discoveri of pasteur and of koch hygien base on statist and the work of zemstvo doctor psychiatri with it modern classif of mental diseas method of diagnosi and treatment wa a perfect elboru in comparison with what had been in the past they no longer pour cold water on the head of lunat nor put strait waistcoat upon them they treat them with human and even so it wa state in the paper got up ball and entertain for them andrey yefimitch knew that with modern tast and view such an abomin a ward no 6 wa possibl onli a hundr and fifti mile from a railway in a littl town where the mayor and all the town council were half illiter tradesman who look upon the doctor a an oracl who must be believ without ani critic even if he had pour molten lead into their mouth in ani other place the public and the newspap would long ago have torn thi littl bastil to piec but after all what of it? andrey yefimitch would ask himself open hi eye there is the antisept system there is koch there is pasteur but the essenti realiti is not alter a bit ill health and mortal are still the same they get up ball and entertain for the mad but still they don t let them go free so it s all nonsens and vaniti and there is no differ in realiti between the best vienna clinic and my hospit but depress and a feel akin to envi prevent him from feel indiffer it must have been owe to exhaust hi heavi head sank on to the book he put hi hand under hi face to make it softer and thought: i serv in a pernici institut and receiv a salari from peopl whom i am deceiv

dmitritch smile iron you are jest he said screw up hi eye such gentleman a you and your assist nikita have noth to do with the futur but you may be sure sir better day will come i may express myself cheapli you may laugh but the dawn of a new life is at hand truth and justic will triumph and—our turn will come i shall not live to see it i shall perish but some peopl s great grandson will see it i greet them with all my heart and rejoic rejoic with them onward god be your help friend with shine eye ivan dmitritch got up and stretch hi hand toward the window went on with emot in hi voice: from behind these bar i bless you hurrah for truth and justic i rejoic i see no particular reason to rejoic said andrey yefimitch who thought ivan dmitritch s movement theatric though he wa delight by it prison and madhous there will not be and truth a you have just express it will triumph but the realiti of thing you know will not chang the law of natur will still remain the same peopl will suffer pain grow old and die just a they do now howev magnific a dawn light up your life you would yet in the end be nail up in a coffin and thrown into a hole and immortality? oh come now you don t believ in it but i do somebodi in dostoevski or voltair said that if there had not been a god men would have invent him and i firmli believ that if there is no immort the great intellect of man will sooner or later invent it well said observ andrey yefimitch smile with pleasur it a good thing you have faith with such a belief one may live happili even shut up within wall you have studi somewher i presume? ye i have been at the univers but did not complet my studi you are a reflect and a thought man in ani surround you can find tranquil in yourself free and deep think which strive for the comprehens of life and complet contempt for the foolish bustl of the world—thos are two bless beyond ani that man ha ever known and you can posse them even though you live behind threefold bar diogen live in a tub yet he wa happier than all the king of the earth your diogen wa a blockhead said ivan dmitritch moro whi do you talk to me about diogen and some foolish comprehens of life? he cri grow suddenli angri and leap up i love life i love it passion i have the mania of persecut a continu agon terror but i have moment when i am overwhelm by the thirst for life and then i am afraid of go mad i want dread to live dread he walk up and down the ward in agit and said drop hi voice: when i dream i am haunt by phantom peopl come to me i hear voic and music and i fanci i am walk through wood or by the seashor and i long so passion for movement for interest come tell me what news is there? ask ivan dmitritch what s happening? do you wish to know about the town or in general? well tell me first about the town and then in gener well in the town it is appallingli dull there s no one to say a word to no one to listen to there are no new peopl a young doctor call hobotov ha come here recent he had come in my time well he is a low cad isn t he? ye he is a man of no cultur it s strang you know judg by everi sign there is no intellectu stagnat in our capit citi there is a movement—so there must be real peopl there too but for some reason they alway send u such men a i would rather not see it s an unlucki town ye it is an unlucki town sigh ivan dmitritch and he laugh and how are thing in general? what are they write in the paper and reviews? it wa by now dark in the ward the doctor got up and stand began to describ what wa be written abroad and in russia and the tendenc of thought that could be notic now ivan dmitritch listen attent and put question but suddenli a though recal someth terribl clutch at hi head and lay down on the bed with hi back to the doctor what s the matter? ask andrey yefimitch you will not hear anoth word from me said ivan dmitritch rude leav me alon whi so? i tell you leav me alon whi the devil do you persist? andrey yefimitch shrug hi shoulder heav a sigh and went out a he cross the entri he said: you might clear up here nikita there s an aw stuffi smell certainli your honour what an agreeabl young man thought andrey yefimitch go back to hi flat in all the year i have been live here i do believ he is the first i have met with whom one can talk he is capabl of reason and is interest in just the right thing while he wa read and afterward while he wa go to bed he kept think about ivan dmitritch and when he woke next morn he rememb that he had the day befor made the acquaint of an intellig and interest man and determin to visit him again a soon a possibl x ivan dmitritch wa lie in the same posit a on the previou day with hi head clutch in both hand and hi leg drawn up hi face wa not visibl good day my friend said andrey yefimitch you are not asleep are you? in the first place i am not your friend ivan dmitritch articul into the pillow and in the second your effort are useless you will not get one word out of me strang mutter andrey yefimitch in confus yesterday we talk peac but suddenli for some reason you took offenc and broke off all at onc probabl i express myself awkwardli or perhap gave utter to some idea which did not fit in with your convict ye a like idea said ivan dmitritch sit up and look at the doctor with ironi and uneasi hi eye were red you can go and spi and probe somewher el it s no use your do it here i knew yesterday what you had come for a strang fanci laugh the doctor so you suppos me to be a spy? ye i do a spi or a doctor who ha been charg to test me—it s all the same —— oh excus me what a queer fellow you are realli the doctor sat down on the stool near the bed and shook hi head reproach but let u suppos you are right he said let u suppos that i am treacher tri to trap you into say someth so a to betray you to the polic you would be arrest and then tri but would you be ani wors off be tri and in prison than you are here? if you are banish to a settlement or even sent to penal servitud would it be wors than be shut up in thi ward? i imagin it would be no wors what then are you afraid of? these word evid had an effect on ivan dmitritch he sat down quietli it wa between four and five in the afternoon—th time when andrey yefimitch usual walk up and down hi room and daryushka ask whether it wa not time for hi beer it wa a still bright day i came out for a walk after dinner and here i have come a you see said the doctor it is quit spring what month is it? march? ask ivan dmitritch ye the end of march is it veri muddy? no not veri there are alreadi path in the garden it would be nice now to drive in an open carriag somewher into the countri said ivan dmitritch rub hi red eye a though he were just awak then to come home to a warm snug studi and and to have a decent doctor to cure one s headach it s so long sinc i have live like a human be it s disgust here insuffer disgust after hi excit of the previou day he wa exhaust and listless and spoke unwillingli hi finger twitch and from hi face it could be seen that he had a split headach there is no real differ between a warm snug studi and thi ward said andrey yefimitch a man s peac and content do not lie outsid a man but in himself what do you mean? the ordinari man look for good and evil in extern things—that is in carriag in studies—but a think man look for it in himself you should go and preach that philosophi in greec where it s warm and fragrant with the scent of pomegran but here it is not suit to the climat with whom wa it i wa talk of diogenes? wa it with you? ye with me yesterday diogen did not need a studi or a warm habit it s hot there without you can lie in your tub and eat orang and oliv but bring him to russia to live: he d be beg to be let indoor in may let alon decemb he d be doubl up with the cold no one can be insens to cold a to everi other pain marcu aureliu says: ‘a pain is a vivid idea of pain make an effort of will to chang that idea dismiss it ceas to complain and the pain will disappear that is true the wise man or simpli the reflect thought man is distinguish precis by hi contempt for suffer he is alway content and surpris at noth then i am an idiot sinc i suffer and am discont and surpris at the base of mankind you are wrong in that if you will reflect more on the subject you will understand how insignific is all that extern world that agit u one must strive for the comprehens of life and in that is true happi comprehens repeat ivan dmitritch frown extern intern excus me but i don t understand it i onli know he said get up and look angrili at the doctor— i onli know that god ha creat me of warm blood and nerv ye inde if organ tissu is capabl of life it must react to everi stimulu and i do to pain i respond with tear and outcri to base with indign to filth with loath to my mind that is just what is call life the lower the organ the le sensit it is and the more feebli it react to stimulu and the higher it is the more respons and vigor it react to realiti how is it you don t know that? a doctor and not know such trifl to despis suffer to be alway content and to be surpris at noth one must reach thi condit —and ivan dmitritch point to the peasant who wa a mass of fat— or to harden oneself by suffer to such a point that one lose all sensibl to it—that is in other word to ceas to live you must excus me i am not a sage or a philosoph ivan dmitritch continu with irrit and i don t understand anyth about it i am not capabl of reason on the contrari your reason is excel the stoic whom you are parodi were remark peopl but their doctrin crystal two thousand year ago and ha not advanc and will not advanc an inch forward sinc it is not practic or live it had a success onli with the minor which spend it life in savour all sort of theori and rumin over them the major did not understand it a doctrin which advoc indiffer to wealth and to the comfort of life and a contempt for suffer and death is quit unintellig to the vast major of men sinc that major ha never known wealth or the comfort of life and to despis suffer would mean to it despis life itself sinc the whole exist of man is made up of the sensat of hunger cold injuri and a hamlet like dread of death the whole of life lie in these sensat one may be oppress by it one may hate it but one cannot despis it ye so i repeat the doctrin of the stoic can never have a futur from the begin of time up to to day you see continu increas the struggl the sensibl to pain the capac of respond to stimulu ivan dmitritch suddenli lost the thread of hi thought stop and rub hi forehead with vexat i meant to say someth import but i have lost it he said what wa i saying? oh ye thi is what i mean: one of the stoic sold himself into slaveri to redeem hi neighbour so you see even a stoic did react to stimulu sinc for such a gener act a the destruct of oneself for the sake of one s neighbour he must have had a soul capabl of piti and indign here in prison i have forgotten everyth i have learn or el i could have recal someth el take christ for instance: christ respond to realiti by weep smile be sorrow and move to wrath even overcom by miseri he did not go to meet hi suffer with a smile he did not despis death but pray in the garden of gethseman that thi cup might pas him by ivan dmitritch laugh and sat down grant that a man s peac and content lie not outsid but in himself he said grant that one must despis suffer and not be surpris at anyth yet on what ground do you preach the theory? are you a sage? a philosopher? no i am not a philosoph but everyon ought to preach it becaus it is reason no i want to know how it is that you consid yourself compet to judg of ‘comprehens contempt for suffer and so on have you ever suffered? have you ani idea of suffering? allow me to ask you were you ever thrash in your childhood? no my parent had an avers for corpor punish my father use to flog me cruelli my father wa a harsh sickli govern clerk with a long nose and a yellow neck but let u talk of you no one ha laid a finger on you all your life no one ha scare you nor beaten you you are a strong a a bull you grew up under your father s wing and studi at hi expens and then you drop at onc into a sinecur for more than twenti year you have live rent free with heat light and servic all provid and had the right to work how you plea and a much a you plea even to do noth you were natur a flabbi lazi man and so you have tri to arrang your life so that noth should disturb you or make you move you have hand over your work to the assist and the rest of the rabbl while you sit in peac and warmth save money read amus yourself with reflect with all sort of lofti nonsens and (ivan dmitritch look at the doctor s red nose) with booz in fact you have seen noth of life you know absolut noth of it and are onli theoret acquaint with realiti you despis suffer and are surpris at noth for a veri simpl reason: vaniti of vaniti the extern and the intern contempt for life for suffer and for death comprehens true happiness—that s the philosophi that suit the russian sluggard best you see a peasant beat hi wife for instanc whi interfere? let him beat her they will both die sooner or later anyway and besid he who beat injur by hi blow not the person he is beat but himself to get drunk is stupid and unseemli but if you drink you die and if you don t drink you die a peasant woman come with toothach well what of it? pain is the idea of pain and besid ‘there is no live in thi world without ill we shall all die and so go away woman don t hinder me from think and drink vodka a young man ask advic what he is to do how he is to live anyon el would think befor answer but you have got the answer ready: strive for ‘comprehens or for true happi and what is that fantast ‘true happi ? there s no answer of cours we are kept here behind bar window tortur left to rot but that is veri good and reason becaus there is no differ at all between thi ward and a warm snug studi a conveni philosophi you can do noth and your conscienc is clear and you feel you are wise no sir it is not philosophi it s not think it s not breadth of vision but lazi fakir drowsi stupefact ye cri ivan dmitritch get angri again you despis suffer but i ll be bound if you pinch your finger in the door you will howl at the top of your voic and perhap i shouldn t howl said andrey yefimitch with a gentl smile oh i dare say well if you had a stroke of paralysi or suppos some fool or bulli took advantag of hi posit and rank to insult you in public and if you knew he could do it with impun then you would understand what it mean to put peopl off with comprehens and true happi that s origin said andrey yefimitch laugh with pleasur and rub hi hand i am agreeabl struck by your inclin for draw gener and the sketch of my charact you have just drawn is simpli brilliant i must confess that talk to you give me great pleasur well i ve listen to you and now you must gracious listen to me xi the convers went on for about an hour longer and appar made a deep impress on andrey yefimitch he began go to the ward everi day he went there in the morn and after dinner and often the dusk of even found him in convers with ivan dmitritch at first ivan dmitritch held aloof from him suspect him of evil design and openli express hi hostil but afterward he got use to him and hi abrupt manner chang to one of condescend ironi soon it wa all over the hospit that the doctor andrey yefimitch had taken to visit ward no 6 no one—neith sergey sergevitch nor nikita nor the nurses—could conceiv whi he went there whi he stay there for hour togeth what he wa talk about and whi he did not write prescript hi action seem strang often mihail averyanitch did not find him at home which had never happen in the past and daryushka wa greatli perturb for the doctor drank hi beer now at no definit time and sometim wa even late for dinner one day—it wa at the end of june—dr hobotov went to see andrey yefimitch about someth not find him at home he proceed to look for him in the yard there he wa told that the old doctor had gone to see the mental patient go into the lodg and stop in the entri hobotov heard the follow conversation: we shall never agre and you will not succeed in convert me to your faith ivan dmitritch wa say irrit you are utterli ignor of realiti and you have never known suffer but have onli like a leech fed besid the suffer of other while i have been in continu suffer from the day of my birth till to day for that reason i tell you frankli i consid myself superior to you and more compet in everi respect it s not for you to teach me i have absolut no ambit to convert you to my faith said andrey yefimitch gentli and with regret that the other refus to understand him and that is not what matter my friend what matter is not that you have suffer and i have not joy and suffer are pas let u leav them never mind them what matter is that you and i think we see in each other peopl who are capabl of think and reason and that is a common bond between u howev differ our view if you knew my friend how sick i am of the univers senseless
